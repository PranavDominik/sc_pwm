Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) For FOC Test Harness
=================================================

:scope: Example
:description: xSIM testbench for PWM component
:keywords: PWM, "Pulse Width Modulation", FOC, Motor Control
:boards: None (works on simulator)

History
-------

WARNING Depreciated: superceded by app_test_pwm in repository sw_foc_motor_control

Features
--------

   * Allows PWM component to be tested before integration into Motor Control loop
   * No Hardware required
   * Due to processing constraints, only one phase of one motor is tested.
