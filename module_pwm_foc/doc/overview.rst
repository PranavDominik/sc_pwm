Overview
========

This module contains a Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) interface component for Motor Control systems.

**FIXME: I moved most of the detail that was here before to the programming guide. The programming guide should contain further guidance on using the API contained ion API.rst, which is currently missing. Including some usage example code from the existing motor control application (not the test harness) would be a good idea.**

**FIXME: This overview section should contain a much pithier summary of what the component can do including - 
  * what is the maximum loop frequency that can be sustained using this PWM block
  * what is the timestep minimum size (e.g. the lentgh of time taken for one PWM cycle (e.g. one of the 4096)
  * how does it different from bog standard PWM with just one channel per leg?
  * what other xSOFip components was it designed to be used with?
